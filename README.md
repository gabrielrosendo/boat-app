# boat-app

Flask-based web application that allows users to book charter boats and view the availability of boats. The application provides a user-friendly interface for selecting available dates, making reservations, and selling boats.


The following are possible improvements that could be added in the future:

- Add Square for charter payment handling.
- Setup company email to receive inquiries.
- Set up and connect to Database.
- Set up galleries and connect pictures to respective galleries.
